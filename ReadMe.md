These are basic sketches for the Nano 33 BLE Sense Ver1 and Ver2.

I put these here because while it's almost certain that sketches like these have been out
there for years, a Web search has real trouble finding them, especially with AI. ;-)

* Nano_33_BLE_Sense_Sensor_Test12: Exercise most of the sensors with data and visual displays.
  This version runs much slower on the Rev2 board.
* Nano_33_BLE_Sense_Sensor_Test16: Exercise most of the sensors with data and visual displays.
* Nano_33_BLE_Sense_RGB_LED_Color_via_Bluetooth1: Display colors in RGB_LEDs via Bluetooth.
* Nano_33_BLE_Sense_Send_Gyro_Data_to_iPhone_Test4: Send Gyro data via Bluetooth to iPhone and also
  display magnitude in RGB_LEDs.
* Nano_33_BLE_Sense_Rev1-2_IMU-TPH_Speed_Test3: Effort to diagnose apparent higher performance of
  Rev1 compared to Rev2 especially for Magnetometer.  The loop reading the magnetic field in X,Y,Z
  runs ~twice as fast for Rev1 compared to Rev2.  In addition, IMU intialization is virtually
  instantaneous for Rev1 but takes a second or more for Rev2.
