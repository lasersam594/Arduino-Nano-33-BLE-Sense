These are basic sketches for the Nano BLE 33 Sense Ver1 and Ver2.

I put these here because while it's almost certain that sketches like these have been out
there for years, a Web search has real trouble finding them, especially with AI. ;-)

* Nano BLE 33 Sense Sensor Test: Exercise most of the sensors with data and visual displays.
* Nano_BLE_33_Sense_RGB_LED_Color_via_Bluetooth1: Display colors in RGB_LEDs via Bluetooth.
* Nano_BLE_Send_Gyro_Data_to_iPhone_Test4: Send Gyro data via Bluetooth to iPhone and also
  display magnitude in RGB_LEDs.
